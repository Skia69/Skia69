### A little bit about me
Hello, I'm Skia, based in Lebanon. I'm a Full Stack Developer with Expertise in Frontend, a graduate of Flatiron School and Re:Coded, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology from the Lebanese International University.

Prior to attending the bootcamp, I was self-taught and have always been passionate about emerging technologies. Currently proficient in ReactJs, Javascript, GraphQL, & TailwindCSS, I continuously expand my skillset.

Approaching each project with a can-do attitude, I believe in embracing new technologies while mastering foundational ones, following the philosophy: "Learn the new but master the old, these are silver but those are gold."
