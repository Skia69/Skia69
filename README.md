### A little bit about me😄
I am a Re:Coded Graduate Frontend Web Developer with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology from the Lebanese International University.

I used to be self-taught prior to having joined the bootcamp and has always been interested in trending technologies - currently experienced in ReactJs, Javascript, GraphQL & TailwindCSS. I happen to be equipped with an ever-growing and promising toolset and I am always looking to expand it.

I face every project with a can do attitude, I believe that "Learn the new but master the old, these are silver but those are gold" is the best approach for using developer tech nowadays.
